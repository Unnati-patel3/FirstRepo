			5. No need of powerful hardware 
			6. Easier branching

2. Working Directory and Staging Area or Index
-> doesn't track the each and every modified files 
-> commit considered for only those files that are in the staging area

Step=2: You add this file to the staging area
Step-3: you may perform the commit operation that moves the files from the staging 
area
